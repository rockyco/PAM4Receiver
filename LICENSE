## Additional Terms

### Educational Use
This project is primarily intended for educational and research purposes,
demonstrating advanced MATLAB-to-HDL transformation techniques and PAM4
receiver implementation methodologies.

### Commercial Use
While the MIT license permits commercial use, users should ensure compliance
with any applicable patents, standards, or proprietary technologies related
to PAM4 signaling and high-speed SerDes implementations.

### Attribution
When using this project or its methodologies, please provide appropriate
credit to the original authors and include a reference to this repository.

### MATLAB Toolbox Requirements
Some features require licensed MATLAB toolboxes:
- HDL Coder™
- Fixed-Point Designer™
- DSP System Toolbox™
- Xilinx® Vivado™ (for synthesis)

Users are responsible for obtaining appropriate licenses for these tools.

## Disclaimer

This project is provided for educational and research purposes. The authors
make no warranty regarding the suitability of this implementation for any
particular application, including but not limited to commercial products,
safety-critical systems, or regulatory compliance.

The PAM4 receiver implementations demonstrated here are simplified examples
and may require additional features, optimizations, and validation for
production use in high-speed communication systems.

Users should conduct their own verification and validation when adapting
these techniques for specific applications.
