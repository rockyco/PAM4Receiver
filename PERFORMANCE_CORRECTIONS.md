# PAM4 Receiver Website Performance Corrections

## ✅ **Corrections Applied**

Based on the accurate performance metrics from `PAM4_Receiver_Design_Evolution_Analysis.md`, the following corrections have been applied to the website:

### **Key Performance Metrics Updated:**

#### **1. Functional Accuracy Corrections:**
- **Before**: 96.08% decision accuracy
- **After**: 95.99% functional accuracy
- **Applied in**: index.html, README.md, technical-details.html, script.js

#### **2. Frequency Performance Corrections:**
- **Basic HDL**: 18.83 MHz (was incorrectly listed as ~40 MHz)
- **DSP Optimized**: 89.16 MHz (was incorrectly listed as ~200 MHz) 
- **Timing Optimized**: 141.28 MHz achieved (was incorrectly listed as 300+ MHz)
- **Applied in**: All website files and comparison tables

#### **3. Implementation Accuracy Corrections:**
- **Original MATLAB**: Reference implementation (instead of 99.99%)
- **Basic HDL**: ~90% functional accuracy (instead of 97.58%)
- **DSP Optimized**: 96.44% functional accuracy (instead of 96.08%)

- **✅ DSP Resource Reduction**: 86% vs naive parallel implementation
- **✅ Framework Success Rate**: >95% transformation success
- **✅ Agent Load Time**: <3 seconds per phase

### **Source Documentation:**
All corrections are based on the comprehensive analysis in:
`/home/amd/UTS/PAM4Receiver/docs/PAM4_Receiver_Design_Evolution_Analysis.md`

Specifically, the **"Performance Metrics Evolution Table"** section (lines 346-357) which provides the authoritative performance data for all implementation variants.

### **Verification Complete:**
- ✅ All website files updated with correct metrics
- ✅ Consistency across all pages and sections
- ✅ Interactive elements updated (JavaScript, animations)
- ✅ Documentation aligned with actual achieved performance
- ✅ No remaining incorrect performance claims

The website now accurately represents the true achievements of the PAM4 receiver implementation and MATLAB2HDL transformation framework.
