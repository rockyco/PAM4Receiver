## üîß **Changes Made**

### **1. Configuration Updates**
- ‚úÖ Updated `_config.yml` with correct GitHub username (`rockyco`)
- ‚úÖ Set proper baseurl: `/PAM4Receiver`
- ‚úÖ Set proper URL: `https://rockyco.github.io`

### **2. Image Zoom Feature Added**

#### **CSS Additions (style.css)**

### **3. Image Path Analysis**
All images are correctly referenced with relative paths:
- `images/pam4_receiver_overview.png`
- `images/pam4_eye_diagram_analysis.png`
- `images/pam4_dsp_opt_hdl_performance_analysis.png`
- etc.

## üéØ **Features Added**

### **Image Zoom Modal**
- **Click to zoom**: Click any image to view full-screen
- **Mouse wheel zoom**: Zoom in/out while in modal view
- **Multiple close options**: X button, outside click, or Escape key
- **Smooth animations**: Professional fade and zoom effects
- **Caption display**: Shows image alt text or nearby caption

## üìù **Usage Instructions**

1. **Click any image** on the website to open it in full-screen mode
2. **Use mouse wheel** to zoom in/out while viewing
3. **Close the modal** by:
   - Clicking the X button (top-right)
   - Clicking anywhere outside the image
   - Pressing the Escape key

## üåê **GitHub Pages Deployment**

The images should display correctly on GitHub Pages with the current configuration:
- Base URL is set to `/PAM4Receiver`
- All image paths are relative (`images/...`)
- No absolute paths are used

If images still don't display after deployment:
1. Check that the repository is public
2. Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
3. Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to build
4. Clear browser cache and refresh

## ‚úÖ **Testing Locally**

To test the website locally:
```bash
# Option 1: Using Python
cd /home/amd/UTS/PAM4Receiver
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Option 2: Using Jekyll (if installed)
bundle exec jekyll serve

# Then visit: http://localhost:8000
```

The zoom feature will work immediately on any properly displayed images.
